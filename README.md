# Blocktown

Blocktown is meant to be a framework on which to build exercises aimed at
teaching and training users in a range of mathematical and algorithmical skills.

## Core Concepts

Blocktown seeks to uphold two core principles in order to better serve as a flexible
framework. First, customizability in regards to visual elements and locale, allowing
any existing exercises to be ported to appeal to other audiences easily. Second,
modularity in regards to the ease of creating new exercises and integrating them
into the existing rewards structure.
