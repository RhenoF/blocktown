# Blocktown

Test Stable Build Available At: https://rhenof.github.io/blocktown/index.html

Blocktown is meant to be a framework on which to build exercises aimed at
teaching and training users in a range of mathematical and algorithmic skills.

## Core Concepts

Blocktown seeks to uphold two core principles in order to better serve as a flexible
framework. First, customizability in regards to visual elements and locale, allowing
any existing exercises to be ported to appeal to other audiences easily. Second,
modularity in regards to the ease of creating new exercises and integrating them
into the existing rewards structure.

## Sample Stages

### Stage 1

Stage 1 follows the traditional STEM approach of presenting a maze-like problem
with increasing complexity. While this approach may seem outmoded, it's a well-grounded
base from which to introduce the user to the tools available to them. An initially
restricted activity allows the user to grasp the basics of the Blocktown control loop
while engaged in tasks with clear goals and defined rulesets.

1) We begin by presenting them with a simple movement task, asking the user to move
the worker unit from point A to point B.

2) At the second level, we present them with obstacles, meant to be overcome by direct
instructions (such as MOVE LEFT, MOVE RIGHT, MOVE DOWN).

3) We introduce dynamic obstacles and the notion of "state". The worker can decide
where to move based on its surroundings, and must navigate a dynamically generated maze.

4) We introduce the concept of performance, allowing the user to prefer certain routes
by consuming resource blocks.
